# DASMOTO'S ARTS & CRAFTS SOLUTION
This is my solution to the Off-Platform Project: Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts that can be found within the Front-End Engineer career path from [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).

## What I Learned
While working on this project, I revisited what I learned throughout the course. In particular:
- Semantic HTML5
- Simple CSS3

Nothing too difficult in my opinion.

## Continued Development
In the future, as I continue to learn and develop my frontend developtment skills, I hope to review the project and see ways in which I can do things differently. Perhaps I can add new things that I have learned. This is something to revisit for sure in the future.
